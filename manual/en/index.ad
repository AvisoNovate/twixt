Twixt is an extensible asset pipeline for use in Clojure web applications.
It is designed to complement an application built using Ring and related libraries, such as Compojure.
Twixt provides content transformation (such as Less to CSS), support for efficient immutable resources,
and best-of-breed exception reporting.

Twixt draws inspiration from http://tapestry.apache.org[Apache Tapestry] and https://github.com/edgecase/dieter[Dieter].

Twixt currently supports:

* link:exceptions.html[Best-of-breed exception report]
* link:http://coffeescript.org/[CoffeeScript] to JavaScript compilation (using Rhino) - including source maps
* JavaScript Minimization (using https://developers.google.com/closure/compiler/[Google Closure])
* Jade to HTML compilation (using https://github.com/neuland/jade4j[jade4j])
* Less to CSS compilation (using https://github.com/SomMeri/less4j[less4j])
* link:stacks.html[JavaScript and CSS aggregation]
* File system caching of compiled content
* Automatic GZip compression
* Automatic CSS Minification (using http://yui.github.io/yuicompressor/[YUICompressor])
* Works with link:webjars.html[WebJars]

== Stability

*Alpha*: Many features are not yet implemented and the code is likely to change in many ways going forward ... but still very useful!
