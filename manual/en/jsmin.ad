title: JavaScript Minimization
---

JavaScript minimization is only enabled in production.

It is set up for _simple optimizations_; this removes whitespace and may shorten variable and function names.

The optimization level is not current configurable.

It is recommended that you make use of JavaScript stacks; this allows the compiler to only be executed once
on a larger sample of JavaScript.
