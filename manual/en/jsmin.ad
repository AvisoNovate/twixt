title: JavaScript Minimization
---

JavaScript minimization is enabled by default only in production mode.

It is set up for _simple optimizations_; this removes whitespace and may shorten variable and function names.

The optimization level is configurable using the +:js-optimisations+ key as described in %={:type :link :page "configuration"}.

It is recommended that you make use of JavaScript stacks; this allows the compiler to only be executed once
on a larger sample of JavaScript.
